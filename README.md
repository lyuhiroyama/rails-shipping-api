# About the project

- A Rails application that manages shipments and exposes them via both HTML views & a JSON API.
- Users can view a list of shipments, see details for individual shipments, create new shipments, edit existing shipments, and delete shipments through the web interface.
- Each shipment has attributes such as tracking number, status, origin, and destination.
- The app includes full RESTful routes for shipments, allowing both browser-based interactions and API requests.
- JSON API endpoints allow external clients to fetch shipment data (index and show) using tools like RestClient.
